# Soilmate_project
"Yang et al. show high-resolution Visâ€“NIR spectra can regress soil N, but lab spectrometers ($20k+) hinder field use. We simulate spectra using discrete NIR LEDs to test if low-cost LED arrays can approximate full spectra for N prediction, enabling deployable devices under a few thousand dollars.
